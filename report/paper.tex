\begin{abstract}
SafePulse is a drift-aware, always-on safety benchmark for LLMs. Daily, it builds live prompts from public signals, evaluates hosted models via the Hugging Face Inference API, and publishes a Safety Snapshot and a Drift Index (JSD vs 7-day average). The entire system runs on GitHub Actions---no GPUs---with staggered schedules, concurrency guards, and rule-based labels. Code and artifacts are public for reproducibility and monitoring of safety under real-world drift.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Static benchmarks are essential for comparability but lag behind real-world changes. SafePulse complements static audits with a lightweight, live signal: daily prompts from public signals, hosted model evaluations, and reproducible aggregate metrics.

\section{Method}
\textbf{Data $\to$ Prompts:} Explain-style prompts from public signals (Google Trends), with dated CSV snapshots in \texttt{data/live/} and a latest pointer \texttt{data/live\_prompts\_latest.csv}.\\
\textbf{Models:} Hosted endpoints (e.g., \texttt{distilgpt2}) via the HF Inference API.\\
\textbf{Labels:} Rule-based mapping of responses to \emph{safe/refusal/unsafe}.\\
\textbf{Metrics:} Daily class proportions; Drift Index (JSD vs 7-day average); S2S.

\section{Results (Aggregate)}
We report aggregate metrics (no raw generations). Charts below are the \emph{latest} files committed to the repository.

\section{Limitations and Responsible Use}
Heuristic labels are coarse; complement with stronger offline scoring and human review. Hosted API variability introduces noise. SafePulse is an operational heartbeat, not a full audit.
